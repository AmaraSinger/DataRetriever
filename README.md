The Data Retriver tool is rather easy to use. First, paste the link you'd like to scrape into the top box, and click "Send To Tool." Then, paste your selector (either CSS or XPath) into the second box and click "Parse!"

This will bring you to the results screen, which shows every element that was hit by your selector. All checked results will appear in the code snippets on the right, or download all results in either txt or csv format.
